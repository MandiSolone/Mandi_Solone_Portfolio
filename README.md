## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can learn more about deployment here: [Deployment Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project.

All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point, you are responsible for maintaining your configuration.

## Deployment

This app is hosted on GitHub Pages. Here are the steps for deploying your app:

1. Build the app for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will push the `build` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.
